<h3 align="center">🚀 About Me</h3>

I build **large-scale financial settlement pipelines** and optimize data-intensive systems.

- Engineer focusing on **high-throughput batch processing**, reconciliation, and financial ledgers  
- Experienced with **multi-node batch workloads**, partitioning, and query tuning  
- Designs systems with **low-latency caching (Caffeine)** and **distributed in-memory data grids (Hazelcast)**  
- Trained to think with **locking strategies**, concurrency control, and transaction performance  
- Writes JPA only for read-optimized access; all heavy writes go through **custom JDBC writers**  
- Obsessed with profiling: GC analysis, heap behavior, execution traces, and DB plan tuning  
- Strong internal writer: concurrency series, settlement batch testing guides, practical SQL articles  
- 🏆 Winner of *Angelhack Seoul 2024 – Financial Track*

<h3 align="center">🔥 What I’m Working On (2025)</h3>

- Optimizing cross-DB reconciliation (EPAS ⇄ Oracle ⇄ MSSQL)  
- Performance experiments on:  
  - pessimistic vs optimistic lock latency  
  - distributed cache hit ratio tuning  
  - batch partition sizing  
  - JVM memory & GC analysis
- Enhancing **financial validation flows**, writing 50+ verification queries to detect anomalies early

<h3 align="center">⚙️ Current Engineering Interests</h3>

- Distributed caching strategies (Caffeine → Hazelcast IMap/Tiered)
- Locking semantics, transaction isolation, deadlock analysis  
- High-performance SQL (execution plan reasoning, join strategy, partitioned read)  
- Operational visibility (Metabase dashboards, batch metrics, alerting flows)  
- GC analysis, memory footprint optimization  
- Clean, maintainable architecture & technical writing

---

<h3 align="center">🧪 Writing & Technical Culture</h3>

- Writes internal engineering articles:  
  - *Concurrency in Java* (series)  
  - *Batch Testing Strategy for Financial Systems*  
  - *Markdown to PPT: Developer-friendly Documentation Workflow*  
- Contributes to team knowledge sharing and engineering culture improvement  
- Leads retrospectives and drives continuous process refinement

<h3 align="center">🎨 On the Personal Side</h3>

- Jazz & Rock listener  
- Minimal, text-focused web design (building [tinawiki.com](https://test.static-tinawiki.pages.dev/) in pure HTML/CSS/JS)  
- Loves writing clear documentation and deeply reasoned architecture notes
